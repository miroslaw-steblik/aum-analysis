# Melt

The melt function in pandas is used to transform or reshape data. It's useful when your data is in a wide format, where each column is a variable and each row is an observation, and you want to transform it into a long format, where each row is a unique observation for a variable.

Here's a detailed explanation of the melt function parameters in your code:
- `df`: This is the DataFrame you want to melt.
- `id_vars`: This is a list of columns that you want to keep the same (i.e., these columns will not be melted). In your case, the 'Year', 'Period', 'Category', and 'Subcategory' columns will remain the same.
- `var_name`: This is the name of the new column that will hold the variable names from the melted columns. In your case, the variable names will be stored in a new column called 'Company'.
- `value_name`: This is the name of the new column that will hold the values from the melted columns. In your case, the values will be stored in a new column called 'Value'.

# Pivot_table
function is used to transform data from a long format to a wide format.

- `index`: This is the column, grouper, array (or list of the previous) you want to group your data by. It will be displayed in the index column (or columns, if you're passing a list) of the pivot table. I
- `columns`: This is the column, grouper, array (or list of the previous) you want to pivot in the new table. 
- `values`: This is the column you want to aggregate. The pivot table will provide statistics for this column.
